WDD 130 Final Website

For my application project, I want to add JavaScript functionality to the final website I made for wdd130. 
It's a Star Wars themed website, so I would use the https://swapi.dev API to retrieve information about Star Wars films. 
The index page of my website has a films box that I will connect to a films page where users can click to retrieve information.Â
